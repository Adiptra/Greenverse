    paragraph: [
      "Humans have had such a profound impact on the world around us that the modern age has been dubbed the Anthropocene — 'The Age of Humans' — a period in which human activity has been the dominant force influencing the environment and climate.",
      "The increasing amounts of energy and materials required to sustain current consumption levels are a danger to the environment as we know. Pollution and waste are damaging water and air quality, altering the climate on a global scale. As the global population continues to grow, more people are moving to cities, and green spaces are disappearing.",

      "Fortunately, many people have begun to take action to slow and reverse humankind's negative impact on the planet. Many are choosing to live more sustainably by biking to work, recycling and reducing their consumption levels. However, sustainable practices must also be implemented on a larger scale to truly reduce human impact on the environment. Landscape architects and developers can play an essential role by designing greener homes and planning greener cities.",

      "The process of incorporating nature into architectural designs and city planning is called green infrastructure and is a crucial step toward a cleaner and healthier world. Green infrastructure can be implemented in a wide variety of ways that provide essential benefits for both humans and the planet.",

    title: "Urban Green Infrastructure",
    paragraph:
      "Green infrastructure integrates plants and other natural elements to make urban spaces more sustainable and environmentally friendly. By tapping into the innate benefits of nature, green infrastructure can address a variety of problems, including water management, urban heat, pollution and climate change. For instance, green infrastructure in cities is often associated with stormwater management because pollution from stormwater runoff can be a major problem in urban areas. Rainwater is typically carried through the city by drainage pipes then deposited into nearby bodies of water. As stormwater runs through the city, it collects bacteria, trash and other pollutants that contaminate the water. To be used again, that water must first be processed in a water filtration plant. Heavy rainfall can also cause flooding and erosion in urban areas with many impervious surfaces that prevent the absorption of water. Green infrastructure provides a better way to manage stormwater by creating natural spaces where water can be absorbed into the earth and processed by plants and trees. When trees absorb water, they purify and release it back into the air as water vapor. This process, called evapotranspiration, provides cleaner air and better water quality. Urban green infrastructure can take the place of traditional grey infrastructure for water management, including replacing costly water filtration plants and drainage systems that carry pollution into waterways. Another way that green infrastructure helps manage stormwater is by constructing wetlands that capture and treat rainwater. Wetlands can serve as a habitat for a range of species and improve water and soil quality. While stormwater management remains a major feature of green infrastructure, the term now includes a variety of environmentally beneficial infrastructure features. As concerns about climate change grow, many elements of green infrastructure are now directed toward reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions or sequestering CO2 from the air. Using natural elements to create cooler cities and buildings reduces energy usage, which then reduces the consumption of fossil fuels, a major source of atmospheric CO2. Trees are planted in cities can absorb and store CO2 from the air in a process called biosequestration, which reduces the volume of CO2 in the atmosphere.",

Rain gardens are similar to bioswales except that they're often smaller and implemented in residential landscapes.",
