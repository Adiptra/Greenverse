By tapping into the innate benefits of nature, green infrastructure can address a variety of problems, including water management, urban heat, pollution and climate change.

When trees absorb water, they purify and release it back into the air as water vapor. This process, called evapotranspiration, provides cleaner air and better water quality. Urban green infrastructure can take the place of traditional grey infrastructure for water management, including replacing costly water filtration plants and drainage systems that carry pollution into waterways.',

Wetlands can serve as a habitat for a range of species and improve water and soil quality.

As concerns about climate change grow, many elements of green infrastructure are now directed toward reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions or sequestering CO2 from the air.',

Bioswales are shallow linear basins typically built near large impervious surfaces such as roads and parking lots. These basins are filled with gravel or foliage that absorb, purify and slow the movement of the stormwater, which reduces the risk of flooding. Rain gardens are similar to bioswales except that they are often smaller and implemented in residential landscapes.',
