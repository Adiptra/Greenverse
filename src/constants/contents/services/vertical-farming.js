            text: "Vertical farming is an innovative method of growing crops and plants by stacking them on vertical multi-level racks inside a controlled-environment building. Each rack has space above that allows vegetation to grow upwards. These high-tech farms drastically reduce the space needed to grow foods, as they can be housed in warehouses, industrial buildings or even skyscrapers rather than using farmland or traditional greenhouses.",
