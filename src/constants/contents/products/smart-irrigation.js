            text: "Rainfall in Oklahoma is variable across the state and fluctuates by year.  During dry periods, irrigation may be needed to preserve landscape quality.  Over- or under-irrigating a landscape can possibly increase disease incidence, waste water and decrease overall landscape condition.  Irrigation system efficiency is dependent upon several factors including design, installation and specific site conditions. Water applied to a landscape can account for a significant portion of a propertyâ€™s water use. In Oklahoma, outdoor water use accounts for approximately 30 percent to 50 percent of household water use. A substantial amount of water is lost to evaporation, wind and runoff as a consequence of improper watering methods.  Reducing or eliminating this loss decreases utility bills and creates a more water efficient, healthy landscape.",

            text: "Outdoor water savings can be achieved using smart irrigation technologies. Smart irrigation controllers and sensors have been developed to reduce outdoor water use by irrigating based on plant water need compared to traditional automatic system timers, which irrigate on a user-determined fixed schedule. This technology exists as a complete controller or as a sensor that can be added to an existing irrigation timer to create a smart controller.  Smart irrigation technology uses weather data or soil moisture data to determine the irrigation need of the landscape. Smart irrigation technology includes:",

Incorporating smart irrigation technology in the landscape can potentially reduce outdoor water consumption. This technology is appropriate for small, residential landscapes as well as large, managed landscapes. The following sections describe how each product functions and the advantages and disadvantages of each product.  Irrigation managers and homeowners should be aware that smart irrigation technology will need to be periodically adjusted and maintained for maximum water savings.",

    desc: "There is a broad spectrum of smart irrigation technology that consumers can benefit from utilizing. Choosing the correct technology for the situation is essential to achieve potential water savings. Watering restrictions exist in some areas of Oklahoma, so the irrigation timer may be adjusted for allowed watering days. Irrigation controllers can be separated into two main categories: Climate based controllers and soil moisture based controllers.",

Evapotranspiration is the combination of evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration by plant materials.  These climate-based controllers gather local weather information and make irrigation run-time adjustments so the landscape only receives the appropriate amount of water.",
